Contains the definitions of the linguistic types, as well as their
public interface. Each linguistic package is implemented in a separate
Python module.

These interface classes need to be given a suitable implementation,
which is used by a physical mapper. These different implementations will use
the particularities of the physical mapping to implement their public
interface.
